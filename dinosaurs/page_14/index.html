<p><img src="/assets/images/dinosaurs/dahalokely.jpg" alt="Dahalokely" /></p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - A rare theropod from the island of Madagascar.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: In 2013 Dahalokely was assigned to the Abelisauroidea.The phylogenetic position of Dahalokely among abelisauroids is uncertain. Its vertebrae and ribs have features of both main groups of abelisauroids, the Noasauridae and the Abelisauridae.A phylogenetic analysis published along with its first description found Dahalokely to be a basal noasaurid, but this result was only weakly supported.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dinosaurs/deinocheirus.jpg" alt="Deinocheirus" /></p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - All we know for sure about this dinosaur is the shape of its arms.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Deinocheirus (/ ˌ d aɪ n oʊ ˈ k aɪ r ə s / DY-no-KY-rəs) is a genus of large ornithomimosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous around 70 million years ago. In 1965, a pair of large arms, shoulder girdles, and a few other bones of a new dinosaur were first discovered in the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia.In 1970, this specimen became the holotype of the only species within the genus …</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dinosaurs/deinodon.jpg" alt="Deinodon" /></p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - This “terrible tooth” is important from a historical perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Deinodon (Greek for “terrible tooth”) is a dubious tyrannosaurid dinosaur genus containing a single species, Deinodon horridus. D. horridus is known only from a set of teeth found in the Late Cretaceous Judith River Formation of Montana and named by paleontologist Joseph Leidy in 1856. [1] These were the first tyrannosaurid remains to be described and had been collected by Ferdinand Vandeveer …</p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - One of the most fearsome raptors of the Cretaceous period.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Deinonychus (/ d aɪ ˈ n ɒ n ɪ k ə s / [1] dy-NON-ih-kəs; from Ancient Greek δεινός (deinós) ‘ terrible ‘ and ὄνυξ (ónux), genitive ὄνυχος (ónukhos) ‘ claw ‘) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur with one described species, Deinonychus antirrhopus.This species, which could grow up to 3.4 meters (11 ft) long, lived during the early Cretaceous Period, about 115 …</p>

<h3 id="136-delapparentia">136. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/ornithopod-dinosaur-pictures-and-profiles-4043320">Delapparentia</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dinosaurs/delapparentia.jpg" alt="Delapparentia" /></p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - This ornithopod was initially classified as a species of Iguanodon.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: The legs of Delapparentia were adapted for its herbivorous lifestyle. Its forelegs were smaller but still capable of supporting weight. This dinosaur’s unique shape likely allowed it to efficiently move through its habitat, foraging for plants. Size Estimations. Delapparentia was estimated to be around 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) in length.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dinosaurs/deltadromeus.jpg" alt="Deltadromeus" /></p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - An unusually speedy theropod of the middle Cretaceous.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Deltadromeus, meaning “delta runner,” was a large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 100 million years ago, in what is now northern Africa. Deltadromeus was a bipedal dinosaur that could grow up to 30 feet in length and weigh up to 1.5 tons. It had a long, slender body, powerful legs, and a long tail.</p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - A poorly understood sauropod of early Cretaceous Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Demandasaurus (meaning “Demanda lizard”) is a genus of rebbachisaurid sauropod dinosaur from early Cretaceous (late Barremian — early Aptian stage) deposits of Spain. Demandasaurus is known from an incomplete but associated skeleton that includes cranial and postcranial remains. It was collected from the Castrillo de la Reina Formation in Burgos Province of Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Diamantinasaurus Size and Description. Diamantinasaurus was a true giant of its time, with a physical structure that embodied the typical traits of sauropods. Short Description of Diamantinasaurus. This dinosaur had a robust body supported by four massive, pillar-like legs, typical of sauropods.</p>

<h3 id="140-diceratops">140. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/diceratops-1092706">Diceratops</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dinosaurs/diceratops.jpg" alt="Diceratops" /></p>

<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - Was this two-horned dinosaur really a specimen of Triceratops?</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: The dinosaur we call Diceratops also rests on shaky ground, but for another reason. This late Cretaceous ceratopsian was “diagnosed” at the turn of the 20th century by the famous paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh, on the basis on a single, two-horned skull lacking the characteristic nasal horn of Triceratops–and given the name Diceratops, by another scientist, a few years after Marsh’s death.</p>
