<p><strong>Brief Description</strong>: - Despite its name, it wasn’t a true tyrannosaur.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Siamotyrannus is a large theropod. Buffetaut estimated its length at seven meters. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 6 meters (20 ft), the weight at 500 kg. [3] In 2016 Molina-Pérez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 10 meters (33 ft) and 1.75 tonnes (1.93 short tons). [4] A possible autapomorphy, unique derived trait, is the possession of two vertical ridges on the ilium.</p>
