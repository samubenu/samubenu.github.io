<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Erliansaurus was by the describers assigned to the Therizinosauroidea, in a basal position and likely not a therizinosaurid. [1] The cladistic analysis performed by the revision of Zanno in 2010 recovered it as a therizinosauroid. [4] Some early cladistic analyses however, have recovered it as a basal member of the Therizinosauridae.The cladogram below is the result of the recently performed …</p>
